# Objective-C ARC Strong Reference Cycle in Blocks

This repository demonstrates a common memory management issue in Objective-C: strong reference cycles created within blocks when using Automatic Reference Counting (ARC).

## The Problem

When a block captures `self` strongly, and `self` also strongly references objects within the block, a retain cycle occurs.  This prevents objects from being deallocated, leading to memory leaks.  The example in `bug.m` showcases this issue.

## The Solution

The solution, demonstrated in `bugSolution.m`, involves using a `__weak` reference to `self` within the block. This weak reference breaks the retain cycle, allowing for proper memory management. Using `__weak` ensures the block doesn't retain `self` strongly.  Careful consideration of memory management within blocks is essential for writing robust Objective-C applications.
